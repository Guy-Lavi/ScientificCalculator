# ScientificCalculator
Scientific Calculator project with complex functions (such as Sin, Log etc) and simple linear equations solver, no math libraries are used.

- Supports infix (with parentheses) and postfix notations.
- Supported functions: +, -, *, /, log/lan, sin, cos, tan and ctan.
- Use π (Pi) and Euler’s number e.
- Solve simple linear qeuations with a single variable (x or y).
- No math libararies are used (all implemented).

Examples:

input: (5+(7-2))*3
output: 15

input: 7 - 3 * x = 1
output: x = 2

input: Log(1000)
output: 3

input: Ln(e*e)
output: 2

input: 3 * x * sin(pi/2) = 6 * x - 9
output: x = 3
